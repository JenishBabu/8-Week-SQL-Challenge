## C.Challenge Payment Question

The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:

   * monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
   * upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
   * upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
   * once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

Example outputs for this table might look like the following:

| customer_id | plan_id | plan_name     | payment_date | amount | payment_order  |
|-------------|---------|---------------|--------------|--------|----------------|
| 1           | 1       | basic monthly | 2020-08-08   | 9.90   | 1              |
